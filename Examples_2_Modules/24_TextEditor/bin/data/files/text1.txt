CPP stands for "C++", which is a high-level programming
language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early
1980s. C++ is an extension of the C programming
language and is designed to provide object-oriented
programming (OOP) features, as well as generic
programming capabilities.
C++ is a compiled language,
which means that code written in C++ needs to be
translated into machine-readable instructions by a
compiler before it can be executed by a computer. C++
is widely used in a variety of applications, including
operating systems, game development, scientific
computing, and financial software.
Some of the key
features of C++ include:
Object-oriented programming:
C++ supports encapsulation, inheritance, and
polymorphism, which are the main pillars of
OOP.
Templates: C++ provides templates, which allow you
to write generic code that can be used with different
data types.
Memory management: C++ provides low-level
memory management capabilities, which allow you to
control memory allocation and deallocation.
Standard
library: C++ comes with a large standard library that
provides a wide range of functionality, including data
structures, input/output operations, and
algorithms.
Overall, C++ is a powerful programming
language that offers a lot of flexibility and control
to developers. However, it can also be challenging to
learn and use effectively, especially for beginners.
